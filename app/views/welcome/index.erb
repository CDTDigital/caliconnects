      <div class="welcome__message-context">California Connects enables you to receive notifications regarding community hazards.  For example:  If a fire is on your street or an earthquake is about to happen, CaliConnects will send you location based alerts.  If you get an alert, the system has intelligently determined that you need the details to stay safe, because you are within the affected area. This also means you won't receive alerts that don't affect you.</div>
